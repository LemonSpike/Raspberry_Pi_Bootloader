TODO list for vc4-gcc
=====================

Insn semantics
--------------

Check unordered/overflow-flag semantics for floating-point comparisons.

Check sign/zero-extension semantics for 16-bit immediate insn variants (arithmetic vs. logic?).

ALU-LSR insn variants ("test5/test6/test7" in arch file)

Is stsh really ldsb?

Binutils
--------

Fix push/pop lr/pc-only encodings. [DONE]

Use macro insns more where appropriate: try to fix "ld/st rN,offset(rM)" disassembly.

Fix relaxation for "ld/st rN,offset(rM)" insns.

Use .s/.m/.l/.x suffixes on insns, and have macro insns for suffix-less variants (with relaxation).

Add support for vector insns.

Support official insn spellings (for push/pop, etc.)

Newlib
------

Add SDRAM/PLL configuration for running on hardware.

GCC
---

Different memory models for "ld/st rN, <symbol>"? Currently limited to 64MB program size because of pcrel addressing with 27-bit relative offset.

GP addressing? (Small data?)
